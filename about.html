        <h2>What the website is about?</h2>
        <p>This website provides information to the begginers who are 
           interested in writing blogs or want to start blogging.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Blogging refers to writing, photography, and other media 
           that's self-published online. Blogging started as an 
           opportunity for individuals to write diary-style entries,
           but it has since been incorporated into websites for many 
           businesses. The hallmarks of blogging include frequent updates, 
           informal language, and opportunities for readers to engage and 
           start a conversation.</p>
